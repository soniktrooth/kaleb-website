    <h1>Kaleb's Comic Co.</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my comic company</p>
    <p>
    My company started when I was in kindegarten I didnt know it but now I do.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was in kindy I only made books with pictures but no words.
    </p>
    <p>
      My teacher (Ms. watt) would let me stay in at certain times to finish my
      previous books I was working on.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was in grade 1 I started writing words in my story to show
      what the character was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In grade 2 I wasn't really much of a book maker but I practiced
      drawing that whole year (I mean I did do school work though the year as well but I did mostly just practice drawing.)
    <p>
      In grade 3 I started making prototype books with
      only like 3 to 6 pages and a lot of spelling mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In grade 4 I started making and even selling my own comic books.
